= Analyzing your content by using the Vale-at-Red-Hat online web app

To get familiar with Vale without installing the Vale software on your local client, you can use the Vale-at-Red-Hat online web app. 
This web app is preconfigured to analyze your content by using Red Hat's style rules.

* To use the Vale-at-Red-Hat web app, visit https://vale.vercel.app/, paste your content or drop a content file in the app window, and click *LINT*.

* By default, the Vale-at-Red-Hat web app displays warnings and errors only. 
You can also view suggestions by using the options menu on the left. 

[NOTE]
