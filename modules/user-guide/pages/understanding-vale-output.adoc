= Understanding Vale output

As a technical writer, you typically run `vale` on the command-line against a content file:

----
$ cd openshift-docs/logging/troubleshooting/
$ vale cluster-logging-troubleshooting-for-critical-alerts.adoc
----

The resulting command output gives you a list of suggestions, warnings, and errors based on customizable styles and vocabulary.

As a writer, you review the output, decide which issues are valid, and update your content accordingly.
