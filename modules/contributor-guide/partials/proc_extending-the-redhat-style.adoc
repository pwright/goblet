= Extending the `RedHat` style

Consider extending styles when:

* A necessary rule is missing.
* The current rule generates false positives with severity `error` or `warning`. The severity `suggestion` intentionally appear when the context is unsure: don't consider these occurrences as false positives.
* The rule message is inaccurate or misleading.


Consider the best approach:

* Extending styles in the common repository
* Extending style specific to the project
