== Outlook

The Debezium 1.9 release stream will remain the current long-running version for the next three months.
During this time, we will continue to evaluate user reports and do micro-releases to address bugs and regressions depending on severity.

Also, quite a lot of work has gone into Debezium 2.0.
We are currently actively working on Debezium 2.0.0.Alpha3 and should have an update on this in the next week.

Stay tuned for more in the coming weeks and stay cool out there!
