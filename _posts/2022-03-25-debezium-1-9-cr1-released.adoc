I am happy to announce the release of Debezium *1.9.0.CR1*!

Besides a range of bugfixes, this release brings the long-awaited support for Apache Cassandra 4!
Overall, https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20DBZ%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%201.9.0.CR1%20ORDER%20BY%20component%20ASC[52 issues] have been fixed for this release.

Let's take a closer look at both the Cassandra 3 changes & Cassandra 4 support.

+++<!-- more -->+++

== Cassandra 3 changes & Cassandra 4 support

=== Cassandra 3 breaking changes

For users who need to use Cassandra 3, the Maven coordinates of the (incubating) connector have changed slightly in this release.
The main change for Cassandra 3 is that the artifact name has changed:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.debezium</groupId>
  <artifactId>debezium-connector-cassandra-3</artifactId>
  <version>1.9.0.CR1</version>
</dependency>
```

There is one additional user-facing change that this release introduces, which is a shift in the Cassandra driver.
The connection configuration is no longer provided directly in the connector properties file but instead must be supplied using a separate `application.conf` file.
You can find a full reference on the driver's configuration https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/4.2/manual/core/configuration/reference/[here] and below is an example:

```
datastax-java-driver {
  basic {
    request.timeout = 20 seconds
    contact-points = [ "spark-master-1:9042" ]
    load-balancing-policy {
      local-datacenter = "dc1"
    }
  }
  advanced {
    auth-provider {
      class = PlainTextAuthProvider
      username = user
      password = pass
    }
    ssl-engine-factory {
     ...
    }
  }
}
```

In order for the Debezium connector to read/use this new application configuration file, it must be set in the connector properties file as follows:

```properties
cassandra.driver.config.file=/path/to/application/configuration.conf
```

=== Cassandra 4 support

For new users and those looking to upgrade to Cassandra 4, the Maven coordinates for the new connector artifact are:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.debezium</groupId>
  <artifactId>debezium-connectr-cassandra-4</artifactId>
  <version>1.9.0.CR1</version>
</dependency>
```

We introduced a new artifact rather than a user configurable toggle as this allows both code bases to diverge as needed.
This allows both the Cassandra 3 and 4 connectors to be refined as needed, as we move forward to building the Cassandra 4 connector with Java 11 as a baseline.

The Debezium for Cassandra 4 connector is based on Apache Cassandra 4.0.2.
If you intend to upgrade to Cassandra 4, the migration should be relatively seamless from Debezium's perspective.
Once the Cassandra environment has been upgraded, adjust the driver configuration as outlined in the above Cassandra 3 breaking changes section and restart the connector.hanges section and start the connector.

== Outlook

With CR1 done, you can expect 1.9 Final either later this week or early next week depending on issue reports.

As we begin to look ahead, you can expect work on Debezium 2.0 to begin in the near future.
The current roadmap is to devote the next two release cycles on Debezium 2.0, releasing it sometime near the end of September 2022.
In the meantime, expect regular updates to continue for Debezium 1.9 throughout this process.
