== Outlook

The Debezium 1.9 release stream will remain the current long-running version for the next three months.
During this time, we will continue to evaluate user reports and do micro-releases to address bugs and regressions depending on severity.

The development on Debezium 2.0 is moving along quite nicely.
We have entered the second half of the development cycle, and we'll begin beta releases with the next release toward the end of July.

Stay tuned for more in the coming weeks, stay cool out there, and happy capturing!
