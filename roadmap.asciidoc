This page describes the roadmap for upcoming work on Debezium.

Debezium is community-driven and as such the roadmap constantly evolves to reflect the users needs and contributions.
You can find a fine-grained list of planned issues and feature requests in our https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ[issue tracker],
but this page is a good starting point to see where we are going.

This roadmap is subject to changes.
Please get https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/debezium[in touch] if you think anything important is missing on the roadmap.

[NOTE]
====
The Debezium community pursues a time-boxed release scheme: minor releases (1.2, 1.3, etc.) are done at the end of every quarter,
with preview releases (1.3.0.Alpha1, 1.3.0.Beta1, etc.) every three weeks.
As our engineering capacity is limited, we're focusing our efforts on a single release line at a time (e.g. 1.3),
i.e. patch releases for the current stable minor release (e.g. 1.2.1.Final) are done in case of critical bug fixes only.
====

== 2.1 - December 2022

* Add new SMT to generate diff change events (exposes only changed fields)
* Embedded Engine improvements
* Oracle connector performance improvements
* Add new storage module for S3
* Debezium UI - Support editing existing connector configurations
* Debezium UI - Support visualization of single message transform (SMT) payloads
* Debezium UI - Support pass-thru connector configuration parameters

== 2.2 - March 2023

* Support configurable signaling channels
* Add schema history compaction tool
* Add new JDBC Sink Connector that natively supports Debezium events
* Rewrite Cassandra connector to use the common connector framework (run within Debezium Server)
* Debezium UI - Support manipulating connector offsets
* Debezium UI - Support displaying critical connector metrics
* Debezium UI - Improvements in connector validation and prerequisites
* Debezium UI - New CLI tooling
* Debezium UI - Support triggering and managing incremental snapshots

== 2.3 - June 2023

* Add source connector making MariaDB a first-class source within Debezium
* Support exactly once delivery semantics (phase 1 - initially one or two connectors)
* Kubernetes operator for Debezium Server

== 2.4 - September 2023

* Support ad-hoc traditional snapshots
* Support exactly once delivery semantics (phase 2 - add more connectors)

== Future Releases

* Two new community-led connectors (currently work in progress)
* SPIs for snapshotting
* Transaction buffer rework for the Oracle connector
* Create PoC for implementing sagas (long-running business transactions spanning multiple (micro-)services) using CDC and the outbox pattern
* Provide a Debezium-specific SPI for describing change event schemas
* API/SPI allowing to implement custom connectors on the foundations of Debezium
* Exploration of creating aggregated events, based on the streams/data from multiple tables, so to enable use cases which need to incorporate data from multiple tables into a single output structure (e.g. an Elasticsearch document containing order and orderline info)
* Explore and provide building blocks for implementing CQRS architectures based on change data streams
* Support for Infinispan as a source
* Allow to propagate custom contextual data in change messages (e.g. the business user doing a certain change)
* Support for Infinispan as a sink (to enable caching use cases)
* Provide more detailed monitoring information about Debezium's internal state and health via JMX (e.g. to spot loss of DB connection while the connector still is running)
* Explore publication of change events via reactive data streams (on top of embedded connector)
* New implementation of the Debezium embedded engine independent of Kafka Connect APIs
